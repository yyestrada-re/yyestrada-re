### ðŸŒ¿ Computer Science + Sustainability

Hi! Iâ€™m Yamilett - a high school senior from Chicago, Illinois. A passionate software developer at heart, I leverage the intersection between CS and environmental science in order to create a more sustainable and environmentally-conscious society.

I had always been interested in CS, but after taking AP CS A and AP Environmental Science my freshman year of high school, I realized that the latter could be used to develop feasible technologies in order to solve pressing environmental crises. 

In the midst of a Digital Revolution, it is undeniable that technology will be the driving force behind the solutions for issues plaguing contemporary society. So whether Iâ€™m creating the next app to clean oil spills or creating a more efficient scrubber system for industrial exhaust steams, my tenacity for inflicting change fused with the knowledge I acquire along the way will strengthen my skill set and allow me to revolutionize the world. ðŸš€

When Iâ€™m not busy programming or organizing an event, you can catch me boxing at my gym, drinking copious amounts of coffee, and jamming out to my favorite band Thrice! ðŸ’ƒ
