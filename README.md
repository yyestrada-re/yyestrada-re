🌿 computer science + sustainability

Hi! I’m Yamilett - a rising high school junior from Chicago, Illinois. A passionate software developer at heart, I leverage the intersection between CS and environmental science in order to create a more sustainable and environmentally-conscious society.

I had always been interested in CS, but after taking AP CS A and AP Environmental Science my freshman year of high school, I realized that the latter could be used to develop feasible technologies in order to solve pressing environmental crises. 

In the midst of a Digital Revolution, it is undeniable that technology will be the driving force behind the solutions for issues plaguing contemporary society. I find that the knowledge I will acquire as a SEES intern will be the perfect launch pad for my career in CS + environmental science - both allowing me to meet other like-minded peers and serving as fuel for my unquenchable passion for knowledge. So whether I’m creating the next app to clean oil spills or creating a more efficient scrubber system for industrial exhaust steams, my tenacity for inflicting change fused with the knowledge I acquire along the way will strengthen my skill set and allow me to revolutionize the world.

At school, I am an avid member of my school’s varsity FRC robotics team, The Chicago Style BotDogs, and the club president for Protostar: a high school accelerator program I launched last year. 

Daughter of a Mexican immigrant family, I am also a fierce advocate for racial + gender diversity in STEM. On weekends, I lead CS workshops for middle-school girls through a non-profit organization called TechGirlz, organize all-female hackathons and conferences, such as SheBuilds and GirlCon Chicago, and much more. Through my experiences, I hope to inspire young Latinas and first-generation Americans, like myself, to pursue careers in STEM.

When I’m not busy programming or organizing an event, you can catch me boxing at my gym, drinking copious amounts of coffee, and jamming out to my favorite band Thrice! 💃
